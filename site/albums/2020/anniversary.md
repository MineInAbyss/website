From ["Mine in Abyss 3 Year Anniversary Update"](https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeInAbyss/comments/k31fpi/mine_in_abyss_3_year_anniversary_update/),
this is the render we display on the site's homepage to this day!
By this point, most of Orth has been built, layer 5 has been in-game for a little bit,
and we can see some survival towns from a previous reset whose ruins remain in-game today!
