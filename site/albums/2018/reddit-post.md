These are the first album images we posted on Reddit: ["Mine in Abyss - Made in Abyss Minecraft Re-Creation"](https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeInAbyss/comments/7ru0kb/mine_in_abyss_made_in_abyss_minecraft_recreation/), 
a follow-up to Thardoc's original post ["Made in Minecraft"](https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeInAbyss/comments/7g1jjh/made_in_minecraft/).
Many of these are screenshots from WorldPainter, the program used by Adar to create the empty map.
At this point the server was running in Thardoc's house, and Orth was just a tiny village!
