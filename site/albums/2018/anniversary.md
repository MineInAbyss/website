These are images from our first anniversary Reddit post ["Mine in Abyss - One Year Progress Update"](https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeInAbyss/comments/a1xlwy/mine_in_abyss_one_year_progress_update).
The render was made in Chunky, the same program we used to create skyboxes.
Each section was rendered one at a time, and the results were merged in Photoshop.
By this point, layer 4 was just added, but you can see some iconic builds throughout the abyss starting
to take shape!
