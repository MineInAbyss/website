title: Mine in Abyss
desc: A community-run recreation of the Made in Abyss anime in Minecraft.
faq:
  ⬇ Is there a map download?: |
    **Downloading the map is not allowed**. While the server is free to play on with a Minecraft account,
    it relies on many custom plugins and a lot of hard work from the community to update and maintain it.

    We keep some of our work exclusive to the official server to help maintain a unified experience and support ongoing development
    that the whole community can benefit from.
    If everything were freely available, it could divide the community into separate groups and discourage sharing contributions back to the source.

    Experience Mine In Abyss as intended on the official server. :)
  🏗 What's the difference between survival and build?: The build server is the "main" server where construction of the abyss is done, and requires permission to build in. The survival server is a way to experience regular survival Minecraft in the abyss. It features the curse, the super deep world, and lets you play together with friends. Griefing, raiding, stealing, and repeated killing are not allowed on the survival server.
  ❎ I can't join the server?: The server does not allow cracked accounts access to it, so that may be one reason. Otherwise please open a ticket in staff-contact with a screenshot of the error-message you are getting, staff will help out as best they can.
  💥 Do I need to worry about spoilers?: The map does not contain any inherent story spoilers, but it's advised to be up-to-date on the anime before playing anyway as people are allowed to talk about all anime content including Season 2. We do not talk about manga-spoilers in non-manga channels, which naturally extends to the actual server-chat.
  💵 What are Orth coins?: You can get Orth coins from exchanging mob drops in Orth, and you can buy items from various villagers around Orth, you can use the command /villagertrades to get more information!
  ❔ I dont understand how to do this in game!: Make sure you have gone through our tutorial (you can find it by following the purple arrows from spawn!) and if that doesn't help you can ask other players in the server for help or in survival-discussion!
