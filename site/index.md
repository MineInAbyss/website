title: Mine in Abyss
desc: A community-run recreation of the Made in Abyss anime in Minecraft.
faq:
  Is there a map download?: No, because the map relies on the server's plugins to function. The map also keeps our project alive and we do not want to segment the community!
  Can I get a map download myself?: As mentioned above, the answer to this is a strict NO. Under no circumstances are you allowed to take a map download yourself by some means, doing so will lead to permaban from the server.
