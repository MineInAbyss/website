desc: Rules for our Minecraft and Discord servers
---

Welcome to our rules page. This is where you will find the rules you should follow for playing on our server as well as using our Discord server. Not following these rules will result in punishment that will be dictated by our Moderation Team.

If you think somebody has broken the rules, or have encountered a problem, get in touch with our staff team in `staff-contact`.

## General Rules

#### Respect

- Be **respectful** to all members of the community and staff.
- **Sexual harassment** towards members or staff is not tolerated.
- Please respect all member’s and staff’s identities and beliefs, your opinions are your own.
- Respect the choice of punishment made by staff, different scenarios have different levels of severity and staff will choose a fairly based punishment upon this.
- Arguing back with staff can result in further punishment, contact us in `staff-contact` instead.

#### Inappropriate Discussion

- Swearing is allowed but preferably kept to a minimum, **slurs are not tolerated**.
- Discussion about sexual/political/controversial topics are not allowed. Our server is not the place to discuss these kinds of topics, please keep these discussions outside of our server and Discord.

#### Other Languages

- **Use English**, it makes it possible for us to moderate.
- Exceptions to this rule are local chat `/local` and DMs `/msg <player>` on the Minecraft server, and the `#non-english` channel on Discord.

#### Spamming and Advertising

- Do not send the same message repeatedly.
- Do not spam emotes.
- This rule extends to DMs if you join our server just to annoy and spamming someone privately will still warrant a punishment on our server.
- Self advertising just for the purpose of advertising is not allowed. You are allowed to talk about other projects you are working on if it’s relevant to the discussion and is meaningful, this is the same for sharing links of others content’s work.

## Minecraft-specific Rules 

#### Stealing
- Stealing from chests is not allowed, even if the chest isn’t claimed.
- Unless the chest is marked to be used for public access, you should not take from any chests that are not yours.

#### Griefing

- Destroying other people's builds is not allowed. Removing clutter such as 1 block pillars or bridges are fine if they aren't actively being used.

#### Exploits

- **Hacking** is absolutely not allowed, baritones and such are not allowed. Mods and scripts for auto-fishing are not allowed either. Admins and Moderators are allowed to use hacked clients for moderation purposes.
- **Report bugs when you encounter them.** Reporting can be done on Discord in the `#bugs-reports` channel, or `#staff-contact` if you believe the bug is severe enough to stay private. *Blatant exploitation of bugs will be punished.*
- Using an **illegitimate copy** of Minecraft will result in a ban. We do not allow people to play on our server with TLauncher or EasyMC because it allows for ban circumvention.

#### The Minecraft World

- **World Downloading** mods are not allowed under any circumstances, *this includes Bobby*. If you want increased render distance, use [Voxy](https://modrinth.com/mod/voxy) or [Distant Horizons](https://modrinth.com/mod/distanthorizons).
- **No ladder shafts/staircases/railways or anything of the sort in Orth to Layer 3.** We want to keep the abyss clean for newcomers.
- **EXP Farms** are allowed but if they are so big that they cause lag they will be removed. Please keep EXP farms minimal, moderators will decide on a case by case basis if the farm is too laggy.

#### Ban circumvention

- Ban circumvention using alts will result in the alts being banned and your ban time being increased.
