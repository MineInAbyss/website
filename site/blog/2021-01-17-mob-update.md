**Attention Delvers!** Urgent message from *Delver Guild HQ*.

There have been recent discoveries that we need to inform you all about.
One of our White Whistles have returned with new information on never before seen creatures.
They have logged 14 new species throughout their descent down to the **5th Layer**.
Know that there are also species we have not made public yet, as we are still gathering intel on them.
Here you will find the [**Bestiary**](https://mineinabyss.com/bestiary) with all the old and newly discovered creatures lurking down in the *Abyss*.
