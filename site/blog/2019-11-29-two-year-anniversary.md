Hello there! This is an update post on the Mine in Abyss project, a recreation of Made in Abyss in Minecraft. It’s been yet another year since our last post, and we’ve been making steady progress, and have a lot of exciting news we’ll share now!

| [Website](https://mineinabyss.com) | [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/2aVhDEq) | [Big album of images](https://imgur.com/a/XvWIwOM) | Our social media is available on the site! |

# Introduction
To start things off, we got a proper survival server setup! You can check it out at `survive.mineinabyss.com` (as well as `build.mineinabyss.com` for build). The server has been around for several months and has a small but wonderful playerbase. It isn’t meant to replace the adventure server, but it’s there for you to have something to play in the meantime. Both servers run on Minecraft 1.13.2.

Last thing before we get into the interesting stuff, we got a site over at [mineinabyss.com](https://mineinabyss.com). You can also chat and get notified of new stuff on our Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/2aVhDEq).

# Major news
#### Barebones gamemode
We started development on a roguelike gamemode (more info below).

#### Builds open to anyone
We’re introducing a new system that will allow you to quickly be able to build on the main server without having to go through building applications. 

Admins and Sr. Builders can give out plots of land for you to build in, right in the abyss! We’re also trying to host build events every two weeks. These are open to everyone, and we’re having one this Saturday, check the Discord server if you’re interested!

#### Custom mobs on survival
A couple months back, we added [custom mobs](https://imgur.com/unT8fPB) to the survival server! There are about a dozen, each with their own models, drops, and even some with custom AI. We have some creatures from the show, as well as some completely custom ones, with each layer holding different creatures. Many of the mobs need to have their AI reworked so they feel more unique, which will be done for the adventure server.

There’s tons of other cool stuff, so let’s get into the details.

# Build Progress

Once gain, take a look at the [big album](https://imgur.com/a/XvWIwOM)!

Here’s what we’ve built in the past year:

* (Not released yet, but) **Layer 5** has been getting steady progress done, and we can expect to see it on both the build and survival servers in around two weeks. Here’s an [album](https://imgur.com/a/vuKSG4Y) of some of the terrain you can expect. It doesn’t spoil anything specific from the manga, but be warned!
* Guild HQ area and stuff behind it
* Layer 3 caves
* Slums update
* Ruins to explore in the abyss
* A complete revamp of layer 2, bringing it to a full 1:1 scale
* A new district has been completed, with another in progress 

# Gameplay
Here's what we have done in terms of code and gameplay:

#### Roguelike gamemode
There is no clear estimate on when we’ll have a playable game, but our new relics system called Looty, and the custom mobs plugin, called Mobzy have paved the path for this. We want to take these systems and wrap them around a super barebones roguelike gamemode to give you something to play.

It will be a simple game that we will build upon over time, where you’ll be able to venture down the abyss with friends to try and reach the bottom! The goal is to keep things simple enough for development to be done quickly, so look out for that.

#### Looty
Forget relics (because we have something cooler!) Looty is a super powerful plugin we’ve created that makes creating relics a piece of cake. You can even make them ingame on the test server at `test.mineinabyss.com`. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jhabjW9jHk) is a video showcasing some basic relics. There are also some [cooler effects](https://imgur.com/a/Bf6hbsM) available.

#### Mobzy
The custom mobs plugin is now known as Mobzy and it’s been split into an API for anyone to use. Unlike custom mobs you see on other servers, Mobzy integrates deeper with the server, which allows us to do really fancy stuff, like custom mob AI. It’s also built around the idea of using custom models (instead of, say, zombies with colored armor). If you’re interested in the mobs themselves, get on the survival server and try fighting them! There’s also an image of all of them together in the big album.

#### 1.14/1.15 update
1.14 has been quite a disaster for servers. It has had a lot of performance hits, which Mojang has acknowledged, and fixed in the upcoming 1.15 update. We’ve decided to hold off until then to update. You can also find an [interesting writeup](https://www.reddit.com/user/sliced_lime/comments/e00ohm/a_word_or_two_about_performance_in_minecraft/) on these performance issues by a dev at Mojang.

#### Other stuff
* Guiy: This probably doesn’t concern you, but we’ve built a system for making GUIs in Minecraft that the other plugins now use. Check it out if you ever need to code a plugin yourself.
* Speaking of which, all of our code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mineinabyss).
* ~~Honorable mention goes to to [Edible Sand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLxkUNFLCHk) (Naatchi from the Discord is to blame for this)~~

# Come help us!
The project relies on people volunteering their time and efforts. We’re trying to make it easier to get started with helping out. Below is a quick list of what we need the most:

* **Developers** - This is currently the most lacking position. We create plugins with Spigot, which uses Java. If you’re at all interested, contact us in #plugin-dev on the Discord server, and we’ll find you something to do, or resources to learn. If you’ve been meaning to learn programming, there’s nothing that works better than a project you’re passionate about!
* **Builders** - Even if you don’t have any skill, we can set up a plot for you to build in, so that whatever you build would actually be used in the abyss!
* **Textures artists and 3D modellers** - Minecraft has a very unique way of creating models, which we use for the custom mobs. Talk to us in #resourcepack in the Discord and we can send some tutorials, and let you design something.

Thanks for reading,

\- The Mine in Abyss Team
