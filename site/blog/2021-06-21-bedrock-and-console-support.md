Due to the Bedrock-edition updating to version 1.17, we are currently unable to add support for cross-play until we update the server.   
When we do, we will make a new post here, as well as announcements on our social media platforms.   
If you have any questions, feel free to join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/mineinabyss) and ask away!   

Recently, we have been testing out support for other platforms than the **Java Edition** of Minecraft.  
This means that people can now join from **Bedrock/Xbox/Playstation//Switch/Pocket Edition**.  
This is only basic support, and most platforms other than PC will be very laggy.  
Features like the *climbing system* & the *custom mobs*, will be semi-functional or just broken.  
We are trying to find a solution for this, but it will take time as we are a small team and other things take priority at the moment.  
In essence, this is to allow people on other platforms to explore the map of the Abyss we have worked hard to make.
 
In order to join, input the information below:  
**Server-IP:** survive.mineinabyss.com  (if this does not work, try joining build.mineinabyss.com)  
**Server-Port:** 19132 (Should be set to this by default)
