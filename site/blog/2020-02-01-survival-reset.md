The survival server (`survive.mineinabyss.com` has been reset a couple days ago, with better server hosting and an upgrade to 1.15.2!

Here is a quick changelist of some other features and what you can expect soon:
- Added the fifth layer
- PVP is now only enabled in layer 4 and 5
- KeepInventory is off in layers 4 and 5, replaced by graves that drop on death. Only you can open your grave, and you can have up to 5.
- Removed/reduced nausea from many layers
- Fixed unmanaged sections and teleporting into overworld
- Walled off the abyss with bedrock
- Disabled frost walker in layers 4 and 5
- Improved flying mob AI
- Better ores spawn deeper down in the abyss

Here are some things you can expect for the future:
- Craftable relics
- Regional curse strength (edges and random pockets of the abyss will have weaker curse
- Fancy custom mob AI
