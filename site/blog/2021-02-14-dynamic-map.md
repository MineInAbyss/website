Welcome to the Mine in Abyss Dynamic Orth Map!

We have recently put a plugin on our server that renders and maps all of Orth.
This means that you can zoom in on any part of Orth for a closer look [here](https://mineinabyss.com/map).

Furthermore, we plan to use this for our upcoming **adventure server** which we will try to have updates on as well as time passes.
When Orth gets more populated with markets, People of Interest and so on, these will also be shown on here.

Essentially a newcomers *Guide to Orth*.
It will also update as our builders add to it on the Build Server.
